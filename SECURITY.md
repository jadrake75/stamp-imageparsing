## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, open up an issue ticket and apply the label SECURITY to it.  
The project owners will examine the issue, determine the impact and provide closure to the issue for the currently
supported version as noted above.  As this project is community run, there is no set timeframe for resolutions.
